I have implemented a Python program that simulates a basic banking system using an object-oriented approach. The Bank class represents a bank and manages customer accounts, transactions, and basic banking functionalities. It has static attributes only for the bank's name, location, IFSC code, and customer information. An account number is assigned to each customer instance. There is a method to add new customers; verify personal details consisting of the phone number, Aadhaar number, and PIN; and carry out transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and PIN alterations. The program keeps transaction histories and can print mini-statements as well. I have also introduced handling errors in cases of wrong user inputs and a retry mechanism after failed authentication attempts. Transactions are recorded in a dictionary format and can be exported to CSV files for future reference.. At the end of the script, I create three customer accounts with various banking operations like deposit,, withdrawal,, balance inquiry,, mini-statement printing,,and CSV exporting.. This system manages multiple users efficiently while allowing essential banking transactions.
